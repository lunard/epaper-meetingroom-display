# ePaper meetingromm display

This repository contains the source code of the ePaper meetinroom display that allows to display:
- the availability of the room;
- the information (e.g. meeting name, organizer, start time, end time, etc.) about the meeting (if booked);
- air quality information (temperature, humidity and CO2 level).

Moreover the display allows, in case the room is free, to book the room fro the next 15, 30 or 60 minutes.
